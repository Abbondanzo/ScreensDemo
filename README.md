# Screens Demo

This repository is a proof-of-concept containing code that will crash if a user navigates back to an activity, containing a React Native Fragment, after that activity has been destroyed. The crash can easily be triggered if you navigate to [Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) and turn on "Don't keep activities".
